- Copy Bone References into Clipboard - reads all the references in bone list of SkinnedMeshRenderer and serializes them into Clipboard
- Paste directly - reads reference list from Clipboard and directly sets bone list to whatever was found in the Clipboard
- Paste based on names - reads reference list from Clipboard, and then goes through the current bone list of the skinned mesh renderer, replacing every bone reference with one that was found in Clipboard
- Set references from hierarchy - goes through the current bone list of the skinned mesh renderer, replacing every bone with one that was found in the provided hierarchy
